The program first imports the `time` module to measure execution time and the `os` module to handle file paths. The algorithm sort the data in `descending order`.

The main part of the program runs only when the file is executed directly.
1. It starts a timer for the whole program.
2. It builds the path to dataset.txt.
3. It reads numbers from the file into a list.
4. If the list is not empty, the numbers are sorted using bubble sort.
5. The sorted result is printed.
6. The program then prints the total execution time.
