The program imports the `time` module to measure execution time and the `os` module to handle file paths. It reads numbers from a text file and allows the user to choose a sorting algorithm from a menu. All sorting algorithms sort the data in `descending order`.

The main program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.
1. It displays the menu and waits for user input.
2. It reads the data from the file before sorting.
3. The selected sorting algorithm is executed.
4. The sorted result and time taken are displayed.
5. When comparing all algorithms, the program shows execution times and identifies the fastest one.
